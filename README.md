The script provided sends a request to the API from the ARP address 192.168.8.1. This means that the request will be sent from the router or modem that is connected to the internet.

If you are running the script on your computer, you will need to make sure that your computer is connected to the same WiFi network as the router or modem. You can do this by opening a web browser and navigating to a website. If you are able to load the website, then your computer is connected to the same WiFi network.

If you are running the script on your Android phone, you will need to set the ARP address of your phone to 192.168.8.1.

The code is a Bash script that automates the process of swapping SIM cards on an MTN Cameroon phone. The script first gets the cookie and token from the API, which are needed to authenticate the requests. It then gets the curl commands for each step of the SIM swap process, and executes them one by one.

The get_headers function gets the cookie and token from the API response. The get_curl_command function returns the curl command for a given URL, cookie, and token. The execute_curl_commands function executes the given curl commands.

The main function of the script gets the cookie and token, gets the curl commands, and executes them.

Here is a detailed explanation of each function:

get_headers(): This function gets the cookie and token from the API response. It first makes a request to the API with the Accept header set to a list of acceptable MIME types. The response from the API will contain the cookie and token in the headers. The function then extracts the cookie and token from the headers and returns them as a string.

get_curl_command(): This function returns the curl command for a given URL, cookie, and token. The function takes the URL, cookie, and token as arguments. It then constructs the curl command with the appropriate headers. The function returns the curl command as a string.
execute_curl_commands(): This function executes the given curl commands. It takes the curl commands as an argument. It then executes each curl command one by one. The function prints the curl command before executing it.
main(): This is the main function of the script. It gets the cookie and token, gets the curl commands, and executes them.
